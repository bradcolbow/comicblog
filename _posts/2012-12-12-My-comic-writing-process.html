<h2>My Comic Writing Process is a Mess</h2>

<p>And I like it that way. Here is what I tweeted earlier today:</p>

<blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/bradcolbow/status/278905237891338240">I have a script for a comic I’ve been sitting on for a while about Flickr feeling all dejected and unused. Might have to toss that one.</a></blockquote>

<p>A couple folks asked if I would share the script anyway. I figured why not so I opened my big document of comic ideas and found a mess of a script. The idea was to give Flickr feelings and have it deal with abandonment. There are 3 variations of the script, I never came up with a punchline for any of them which is probably why it never left the big document of ideas.</p>

<p>This is how I work: I jot down dozens of ideas as they come to me every week and then when I have time I go back and see if there is something more to them. Unfortunately this makes for excruciatingly bad and boring scripts but is a pretty good way to collect ideas.</p>

<h3>v1 Trying to break up with Flickr:</h3>
<ul>
<li>FL: You used to love me.</li>
<li>Brad: I still do.</li>
<li>FL: But you never use me.</li>
<li>Brad: It’s just easier to use Facebook or Instagram</li>
<li>FL: Can you group your photos in sets? Can you tag them? Is the quality any good.</li>
<li>Brad: Listen it’s not you it’s me.</li> 
<li>FL: I see, </li>

<h3>v2</h3>
<li>Brad: Happy Birthday Flickr!</li>
<li>FL: Aw thanks guys, you shouldn’t have. </li>
<li>FL: What are you doing?</li>
<li>Brad: Taking your picture.</li>
<li>FL: With that brick?</li>
<li>FL: You own a f-ing Panteck super sync 9000 and you’re using your phone?!?</li>
<li>FL: You used to be a real photographer not falling for every pretty filter that batted her eyelashes at you!</li>

<h3>v3</h3>
<li>FL: Happy birthday Brad!</li>
<li>Brad: Flickr! You scared me, and it’s not my birthday </li>
<li>FL: Well if you have filled out the new forms on the about page I would have known that</li>
<li>Brad: I didn’t know…</li>
<li>FL: Of course you didn’t, you haven’t logged in since March</li>
<li>FL: Where have you been Brad?</li>
